        <h2 id="Anchor"> What makes a superhero? </h2>
           
        <p>
            A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a  
            <br> superhero, <strong>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess </strong>, and you need to use 
            <br> that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
            <br> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it's a 
            <br> good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal
            <br>human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.
