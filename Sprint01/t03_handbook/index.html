        <div class="div4"><p>HTML offers six different levels of headings that indicate the relative importance of the section after the heading. 
            Thus, the "h1" tag represents the most important first-level heading, 
                while the "h6" tag serves to indicate the sixth-level heading and is the least important.</div>
        <div class="div5">&lt;h1&gt;Text&lt;h1&gt;</div>
        <div class="div6"><h1>Text</h1></div>

        <div class="div7"><p>The "head" tag is intended to contain other elements, the purpose of which is to help the browser work with data. 
            Also inside the "head" container are meta tags that are used to store information intended for browsers and search engines. 
                For example, search engine engines refer to meta tags to retrieve site descriptions, keywords, and other data.</p></div>
        <div class="div8">&lt;head&gt;Code&lt;head&gt;</div>
        <div class="div9">A normal html command that doesn't have a view</div>

        <div class="div10"><p>The "legend" tag is used to create the title of a group of form elements, which is defined using the "fieldset" tag. 
            A group of elements is indicated in the browser with a frame, and the text that is inside the "legend" container is embedded within the frame</div>
        <div class="div11">&lt;legend&gt;Code&lt;legend&gt;</div>
        <div class="div12"><fieldset><legend>Legend</legend></fieldset></div>

        <div class="div13"><p>Establishes a link to an external document such as a style sheet or font file. 
            Unlike the "a" tag, the "link" tag is always placed inside the "head" container and does not create a link.</p></div>

        <div class="div17">font-size: 10px</div>
        <div class="div18"><p style="font-size: 30px">Size</p></div>

        <div class="div29"><p>IP</p></div>
        <div class="div30"> <p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP
            stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the
            internet or local network. <br>
            In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a
            network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The
            internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP
            addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works. <br>
            To find ip of site we need: <br>
            1. Open console <br>
            2. ping site <br></p></div>
        <div class="div31"><p> For example: <br>
            google.com - 172.217.18.78 <br>
            google.com.ua - 172.217.20.3 <br>
            ucode.world - 207.154.232.87</p></div>

        <div class="div32"><p>HTTP</p></div>
        <div class="div33"><p> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed,
            collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for
            the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user
            can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.<br>
            Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. Development of early HTTP
            Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
            and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.<br>

        <div class="div35"><p>HTTPS</p></div>
        <div class="div36"><p> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
            (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the
            Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security
            (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP
            over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.<br>
            The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of
            the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against
            man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and
            server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering. The authentication
            aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates. This was
            historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS connections were usually
            found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems
            on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier Foundation with the support of
            web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent. HTTPS is now used more often
            by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types
            of websites; secure accounts; and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing
            private.<br>

        <div class="div38"><p>DNS</p></div>
        <div class="div39"><p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online
                                through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol
                                (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
            
            Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the
                                device. 
            ...</p></div>
        <div class="div40">DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in
            IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in
            IPv6).<br></div>
